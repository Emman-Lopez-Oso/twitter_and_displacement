# Twitter and Displacement

This projects implements predictive analysis of gentrification and displacement on the basis of geo-tagged tweets based metrics.  
For this a number of metrics are designed and implemented, including:
Twitter users home-location and work-location analysis.
Aggregation of twitter activity in the territory by residents and non-residents.
Dynamic (time-series style) analysis of tweet activity to detect changes in time.
   

# Dependencies and Installation

For spatial analysis tasks this project uses Geopandas and the H3 library.

Windows users might face problems installing H3. I suggest using a Linux subsystem. 
A complete explanation for such an installation is available [here](https://ricardopasquini.com/installing-h3-on-windows-10/)
